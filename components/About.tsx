          My past experience communicating with clients has made me skilled at understanding their needs and helping them find the solutions they're looking for. Using that insight as a foundation is one of the ways I want to dedicate myself to my craft. The experience I've gained from working as a consultant has strengthened my ability to approach and solve problems, and I know this journey will continue to be both rewarding and exciting.

          I enjoy watching films and documentaries, and also love games like Animal Crossing. I'm passionate about documenting my life and the lives of my friends—for the past few years, I've been carefully selecting and sharing photos on a near-weekly basis that capture this stage of my journey.
