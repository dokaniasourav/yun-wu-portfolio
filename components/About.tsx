          My past experience communicating with clients had made me good at understanding them and helping them find the solutions they wanted, and using that thinking as a starting point was one of the ways I wanted to dedicate myself, I think.

Sometimes obsessed with documenting my life and the lives of my friends, and for the past few years I've been picking out, on average, almost weekly, photos that I feel comfortable sharing at this stage of my life.
